What Are Good Starting Words In Wordle?
A good strategy would be to start with words with many of the most common letters.
 Here is a short list of ideas: "STONE," "TRAIN," "NOTES," "RAINS," "STAIR," "STORE," "RAISE," "SAINT," "STERN," or "ROAST."
  Another option is five letter words with 3 vowels, such as ", AUDIO", "QUIET," "OUNCE," "ERASE," "AISLE," or "AISLE."
  This isn't a complete list, but it should be enough to get you started. You can view the complete Wordle Word List
